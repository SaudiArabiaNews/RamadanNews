    <h1 class="main">Ramadan News Leaves The World In Shock</h1>
    
    <p class="p">Everyone knows that Ramadan starts in April second, but the weather forecast team and SA and Kuwait Ramadan Timer team have no evidence, they went with a random date to play with it and reduce panic for muslims. It is official that there isn't ramadan this year, just government lying to people to keep them sane.
    <br>
    <br>
    Same events happened for Ramadan 2014, Ramadan 2012 and Ramadan 2009, officials say that they do this so the public doesn't panic and go insane causing riots and people to stop believing in Islam.
    <br>
    <br>
    Although do not worry, the government of Bahrain said they don't have ramadan moons at all due to their geographical location but they make people believe so, and they still gain virtues for it. You can fast anytime and gain equal Virtues so Bahrainian people didnt mind Ramadan not being in their country.
